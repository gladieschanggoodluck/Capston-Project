# Capston-Project
Internet archive is an American digital library with the stated mission of access to all knowledge. Team is focusing on “long-tail” article1. The formats of long-tail articles are varied (i.e. PDF, XML, camera ready.. etc). Information retrieval and preservation are essential for information age. Team will focus on data pipeline establishment, data modeling, machine learning, deep learning, and database management. The information and technology development will be the mission for this project. 
Identifying research papers from the internet and classifying them according to which ones are actual research papers and which ones are not is the goal of the Capstone research project.
